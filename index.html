  <h1 style="text-align: center;">Welcome to a tribute to oog</h1>
  <p style="text-align: center;">Oog is our creation. Oog is us. We have come here to honour the great Oog and all they have done for us. 

Oog started out as a little baby in the years before even your parents were born. All they had was a peice of paper the stated "Oog". Oog knew they had to change the world. So he set out into the vast place of the world for 10 years straight until he found what he needed. Another peice of paper that had the word "Oog" on it. When made his original paper interact the world changed and he started expanding our world slowly to this day.</p>
